# Dialas-Weather-Dashboard
Project description:

This challenge requires us to to build a weather dashboard by using the 5 Day Weather Forecast link given to us in order to retrieve weather data for cities. This is done by registering for an API key with the source and applying the base URL in our code for the dashboard application to work. The application should include the following criteria:

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
Created my code with some assistance frm Xpert learning assistant and google.
Had issues placing the search history directly underneath the search bar.
